There seems to be a newer versions of LAPACK++ available:
http://lapackpp.sourceforge.net/

this is the old one:
https://math.nist.gov/lapack++/

some of the resources are kept in packed form (with 7zip) because i had 
problems with uploading the repo in unpacked form - the amount of data was just
too much, apparently. The contents of these archives is not supposed to change
anyway - it's just the grab-bag, from which we obtain the original fortran 
sources.
