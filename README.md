# LAPackCPP

With this repo, i try to translate the original LAPACK Fortran routines to C++, by letting them first being automatically translated to C by the f2c.exe commandline tool and then manually editing the results afterwards. The motivation was that at one point, i needed a solver routine for pentadiagonal linear systems for my RAPT library. After looking into various options, i decided that this is the way to go. 

I just started with this, so at the moment, not very much has been translated yet. But i hope that over time, this repo may evolve to a more and more complete translation of this venerable, classic and awesome library. I don't know, how fast this will go - it will probably depend on what specific functionality from LAPACK i will need for my other projects (RAPT in particular).

For the licensing, i apply the same liberal licensing scheme as applies to the original Fortran code - anything else would be very unfair.

...tbc...
