Some functions define static local variables (for example laswp) - maybe we 
should use non-static local varibales instead? because when two different 
threads use a routine concurrently, each needs it own local variables. Maybe 
define a macro LA_STATIC that evaluates to static - so we may globally select
whether static or local (stack-allocated) variables shall be used. When there
are a lot of local variables, maybe we could get stack overflow, if they are 
not static? We should have the option to roll back to static, if necessarry, 
so using a macro seems a suitable approach.


For the naming conventions: We have currently retained the l and i prefixes
(for example in iamax, lsame) for routines that work with integers and 
logicals (mostly they return values of the respective type). Maybe get rid
of these prefixes, too - or maybe not.
