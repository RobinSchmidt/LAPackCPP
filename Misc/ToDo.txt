Some functions define static local variables (for example laswp) - maybe we 
should use non-static local varibales instead? because when two different 
threads use a routine concurrently, each needs it own local variables.

For the naming conventions: We have currently retained the l and i prefixes
(for example in iamax, lsame) for routines that work with integers and 
logicals (mostly they return values of the respective type). Maybe get rid
of these prefixes, too - or maybe not.
