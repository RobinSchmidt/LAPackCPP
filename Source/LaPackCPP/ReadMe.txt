Some of the BLAS and LAPACK routines originally needed code from the files in
the LibF2C and XBlas directories. The relevant code has been copied into 
LibF2C.hpp/cpp and XBlas.hpp/cpp and adapted, so these subdirectories are just
for reference and to grab new code from, when the files must be updated to 
include new functionality.
